## 🧰 Local Development — Quick Start

### Prerequisites

* Node.js (recommended 16+)
* Git

### Run locally

```bash
# clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/portfolio.git
cd portfolio

# install deps
npm install

# start dev server
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:5173` (or the port shown by Vite).

---

## ☁️ Deployment

### Deploy to Vercel

1. Push the repository to GitHub.
2. Sign in to [Vercel](https://vercel.com) and import the repo.
3. Use default build settings (Vite). Set any required environment variables.
4. Deploy — your site will be live on a vercel.app subdomain.

### Demo: HR Outreach

The HR Outreach project includes a safe demo mode (simulation) and Mailtrap integration for previewing email output without sending to real recipients. Consider deploying the demo as a small Flask app (see project README) and exposing the demo behind an opt-in page.

## 📝 README Tips & Good Practices

* Add a `README.md` inside each project folder with: what it does, how to run, tech stack, and screenshots.
* Include `LICENSE` if you want to open-source any project.
* Add `.env.example` showing environment variable names (without secrets).
